# intuitiveAPI

A small project where I tried to make code that would link up frontend API endpoints to the backend .

I always found it frustrating when I'd add an API endpoint on the back end and have to manually go and put it in on the frontend so I tried to make some scripts that would let me link them up but got busy with school!
Hopefully in the future I'll be able to finish this project.
